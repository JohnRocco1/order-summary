Frontend Mentor Order Summary
This is my first challenge.
Although I think it looks correct, I'm not sure my code is clean
i.e. could I have done it better to achive the same results.
I had to go back to some of the online coures I've done because 
I don't always remember which properties to use in my css file.
I would appreciate any comments on how I could do it better. TIA
